# Hangman Game (Vanilla JS)

## Version 2 and improvements:

**The Plan**
Version 2 started out with good Gulp intentions; however, since then, gulp-cssnano is deprecated and has issues. Will regulp for practice but later. 
I also return to this to play with testing.
In addition, I want the player to choose the theme from a list as well as other ways to make the game more user friendly (keep track of wins, etc ...).

[Blog post on branches]('http://ihatetoast.io/2018/08/18/gitty-up-with-baby-steps/')

To do:

-[x] Make tests for new fcn to ignore - spaces and '

-[x] Add new fcn for new fcn to ignore - spaces and '

-[ ] Keep track of losses

-[x] Keep track of wins

-[ ] Offer buttons that load different themes

Someone suggested that I keep track of the guesses remaining, but there's a stick figure dying outside of the school in front of the students. His only role is to show you how many guesses are left. Do I need to add another field or is that just making code to prove something. Currently undecided.

## Previous Versions:

**Version 1: Theme is Pants!**

The classic hangman game where the player chooses letters to guess a word. Good guesses leave the chalkboard and appear in the dashes below. Bad guesses are noted in red, and a body part appears outside on the gallows.


Why does it take too long to finish version 2? Because there's so much other stuff to learn. So. There you have it.
