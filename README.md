# Hangman Game (Vanilla JS)

Version 1: Theme is Pants!
This version was done as an assignment and was completed in seven days.
The classic hangman game where the player chooses letters to guess a word. Good guesses leave the chalkboard and appear in the dashes below. Bad guesses are noted in red, and a body part appears outside on the gallows.

Version 2 and improvements:
The Plan
This version and those after are to bring in good habits: Gulp, Git branch, testing, DRY out.
In addition, I want the player to choose the theme from a list as well as other ways to make the game more user friendly (keep track of wins, etc ...).
Although I wish to add improvements, I am keeping this in vanilla JavaScript because I want to. Sorry, jQuery. You'll get your turn later.
