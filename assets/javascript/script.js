// PSEUDOCODE
// need a list of words
// need to grab one of those words at random
// 	and need to store that word.
// need to have an alphabet array

// need to make spaces/dashes for that word

// need to get user's guess for a letter
// need to check user's guess against the randomword
// 	if it's correct, letter appears in place of the dash
// 	if it is incorrect, a body part is shown (so many jokes here) AND letter guessed is put into an incorrect box

// ?store guessed letters in another array and remove them from alpha?
// store incorrect guesses in an array. number of letters = number of parts shown?

// announce win or loss
